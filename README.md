# SGDK-ROMS
This is where you'll be able to download the technical demos I have been working on SGDK.

To summarize :

-- Finished --
--- post_office.bin : I love the animation in this one and the color palette
--- rom_bakery_minish_cap.bin : Another nice place I managed to recreate in game
--- witch_hut.bin : One of my favourite place to recreate, that one had many versions before I managed to display all the sprites, animations, and use the best palette colors, love the music as well !

--- malon_house_01.bin / malon_house_02.bin : My first try recreate Malon's house while keeping the overall decent looking
--- rom_dampe_shack_minish_cap.bin : First time I was working on dialogs, decent but buggy
--- simon_simulation.bin : One of the first house I recreated with animations
--- title_screen.bin : The tile screen, best recreation I did, but can always be improved.
  
-- In development --
--- lonlon_ranch.bin : This one is currently in development, I was checking how many sprites I could have one screen while having a decent looking map
--- south_hyrule_map.bin : Attempt to recreate a large field, that was supposed to be where my demo would start, I'll surely redo it completely now that I know how to handle large areas (thanks to the Lonlon ranch).

-- Abandoned -- 
--- hyrule_city.bin : You can explore parts of Hyrule city, it's really buggy
--- hyrule_town_v0.01.bin : The first "encounter" I developed back in the day against a monster
--- mama_cafe.bin : that was supposed to be where you could have done a sidequest, very buggy collisions, if you press the right button at the right place you can transform into a minish
--- menu_items.bin : Attempts to recreate the item menu from the game and switching the weapon / shield from one button to another, buggy.
