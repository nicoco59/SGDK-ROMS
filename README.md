# SGDK-ROMS
This is where you'll be able to download the technical demos I have been working on SGDK.

I started this project years ago because I wanted to prove that a game like Zelda the Minish Cap with great pixel art could have been handled by the Megadrive and that more action adventure games like Zelda could have been developed back in the day.

A bit of explanations for all the demos on this page :

-- Finished --

--- epilogue.bin : Stupid epilogue I did for the game, I tried to convert the pictures the best I could, it was also my first time dealing with multiple "dialogs" (and obviously not being able to do it well), keep the B button pressed to see the next texts.

--- witch_hut.bin : One of my favourite place to recreate, that one had many versions before I managed to display all the sprites, animations, and use the best palette colors, love the music as well !

--- post_office.bin : I love the animation in this one and the color palette (it's missing the postman running and coming out of the building though)

--- rom_bakery_minish_cap.bin : Another nice place I managed to recreate in game, as a french I couldn't not make it.

--- malon_house_01.bin / malon_house_02.bin : My first try recreate Malon's house while keeping the overall decent looking

--- rom_dampe_shack_minish_cap.bin : First time I was working on dialogs, decent but buggy

--- simon_simulation.bin : One of the first house I recreated with animations

--- title_screen.bin : The tile screen, best recreation I did, but can always be improved.
  
-- In development --

--- lonlon_ranch.bin : This one is currently in development, I was checking how many sprites I could have one screen while having a decent looking map

--- south_hyrule_map.bin : Attempt to recreate a large field, that was supposed to be where my demo would start, I'll surely redo it completely now that I know how to handle large areas (thanks to the Lonlon ranch).

-- Abandoned -- 

--- hyrule_city.bin : You can explore parts of Hyrule city, it's really buggy

--- hyrule_town_v0.01.bin : The first "encounter" I developed back in the day against a monster

--- mama_cafe.bin : that was supposed to be where you could have done a sidequest, very buggy collisions, if you press the right button at the right place you can transform into a minish

--- menu_items.bin : Attempts to recreate the item menu from the game and switching the weapon / shield from one button to another, buggy.
